#### Methods summary: 
Infants were shown images of everyday objects with mono- or trisyllabic names. The infants' eye movements were recorded. There was a training phase and a test phase. In the training phase, images were first presented in the center of the screen and the name of the object was played as sound. Next, the objects were presented on one side. Objects with monosyllabic names were always presented on one side and objects with longer names on the other. In the test phase, infants were presented images of new objects with names they could comprehend but not produce. The object appeared first in the center, with no auditory stimulus, and then on one side, depending on the word length. The question was whether the infants would look to the side the image appeared on in anticipation.

#### Target outcomes: 
For this article we will focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 2.2. Specifically, we will attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> During the learning phase, infants showed at least one left or right look in 81% of the trials. Infants’ mean scores were not significantly above chance for either initial accuracy (mean = −0.02, SE = 0.03, t(30) < 1) or overall accuracy (mean = −0.002, SE = 0.03, t(30) < 1, ns). During the test phase, they showed at least one left or right look in 83% of the trials. The mean latency of the first look was 625 ms (SD: 141 ms), and its mean duration 819 ms (SD: 238 ms). Infants’ mean accuracy scores were significantly above chance, considering both initial accuracy (mean = 0.12, SE = 0.04, t(30) = 3.25, p = 0.0014; see Fig. 2, left panel) and overall accuracy (mean = 0.06, SE = 0.03, t(30) = 1.69, p = 0.050).

## Step 1: Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
library(CODreports) # custom report functions
sem <- function(x) {sd(x, na.rm=TRUE) / sqrt(length(x))} # custom function to calculate standard error of the mean
```

## Step 2: Load data

```{r}
data <- d <- read_excel("data/data.xlsx", sheet = 2)
```

## Step 3: Tidy data

```{r}
data <- d <- d %>%
  mutate(scorefirstlook = as.numeric(scorefirstlook)) %>% # Change from character to numeric
  filter(pronounced == "no") # Exclude trials with pronounced words, see footnote on page 54
```

## Step 4: Run analysis

### Pre-processing

For each participant, scores were calculated and scaled, and weights were determined for each participant depending on the number of trials with a recorded response (section 2.2, page 55):

> Two individual accuracy measures were computed based on infants’ left and right looks (hence excluding the other looks): initial accuracy, defined as proportion of first fixations to correct side, and overall accuracy, defined as proportion looking time to correct side. Both scores were scaled such that they ran from -1, corresponding to 100% incorrect anticipations, to +1, corresponding to 100% correct anticipations, with 0 representing performance at chance level. To test whether infants’ mean accuracy scores were significantly above chance, we ran onesided t-tests. Given that the number of analyzable test trials varied widely across infants (mean = 14.9; range = 4–27), both because the number of trials was variable and because infants did not necessarily show at least one left or right look in all trials, we used a weighted version. In this version, the contribution of individual infants’ accuracy scores to the t-statistic is proportional to their number of anticipated trials.


```{r}
# Determine "initial accuracy"" for each individual, training data
# Initial accuracy is helpfully given by the "scorefirstlook" variable, which we have used as it is, without attempting to reconstruct it from raw data. Scaling is applied.

initialAccTraining <- d %>% 
  filter(phase == "training", attempted == "yes") %>% 
  group_by(subj) %>%
  summarise(initialAcc = sum(scorefirstlook, na.rm = T)/n(), 
            n_obs = n()) %>%
  mutate(initialAccScaled = initialAcc * 2 - 1)

initialAccTest <- d %>% 
  filter(phase == "test", attempted == "yes") %>% 
  group_by(subj) %>%
  summarise(initialAcc = sum(scorefirstlook, na.rm = T)/n(), 
            n_obs = n()) %>%
  mutate(initialAccScaled = initialAcc * 2 - 1)
```

```{r}
# Determine overall accuracy for each individual defined as "proportion looking time to correct side"
# LTcorrect should be absolute looking time to correct side.
# total looking time is 2000ms.

```



### Descriptive statistics

#### Left or right look during learning phase
Reported:

> 81%

```{r}
v1 <- round(sum(data[data$phase == "training", ]$attempted == "yes")/length(data[data$phase == "training", ]$attempted), 2)
compareValues(reportedValue = 0.81, obtainedValue = v1)
```

#### Left or right look during test phase
Reported: 

> 83%

```{r}
v2 <- round(sum(data[data$phase == "test", ]$attempted == "yes")/length(data[data$phase == "test", ]$attempted), 2)
compareValues(reportedValue = 0.83, obtainedValue = v2)
```

#### First look latency and duration
Reported (referring to test phase): 

> The mean latency of the first look was 625 ms (SD: 141 ms), and its mean duration 819 ms (SD: 238 ms).

```{r}
v3 <- round(mean(data[data$phase == "test" & data$exclude_trial == F, ]$RT), 0) # mean latency
v4 <- round(sd(data[data$phase == "test" & data$exclude_trial == F, ]$RT), 0) # sd latency
v5 <- round(mean(data[data$phase == "test" & data$exclude_trial == F, ]$firstlookdurations), 0) # mean duration
v6 <- round(sd(data[data$phase == "test" & data$exclude_trial == F, ]$firstlookdurations), 0) # sd duration

compareValues(reportedValue = 625, obtainedValue = v3) # mean latency
compareValues(reportedValue = 141, obtainedValue = v4) # sd latency
compareValues(reportedValue = 819, obtainedValue = v3) # mean duration
compareValues(reportedValue = 238, obtainedValue = v4) # sd duration
```


### Inferential statistics

#### Training phase
Reported: 

> Infants’ mean scores were not significantly above chance for either initial accuracy (mean = −0.02, SE = 0.03, t(30) < 1) or overall accuracy (mean = −0.002, SE = 0.03, t(30) < 1, ns).

```{r}
# Initial accuracy, training
ttest1 <- t.test(initialAccTraining$initialAccScaled, weights = initialAccTraining$n_obs, alternative = "greater")
se1 <- sem(initialAccTraining$initialAccScaled)

ttest1

compareValues(reportedValue = -0.02, obtainedValue = round(ttest1$estimate, 2)) # mean
compareValues(reportedValue = 0.03, obtainedValue = round(se1, 2)) # SE
compareValues(reportedValue = 30, obtainedValue = ttest1$parameter) # df

# Overall accuracy, training
ttest2 <- t.test(data_overall_training$overall_accuracy, weights = data_overall_training$n_obs, alternative = "greater")
se2 <- round(abs((ttest2$conf.int[1] - ttest2$estimate) / 1.96), 2)
ttest2$statistic
ttest2$p.value

compareValues(reportedValue = -0.002, obtainedValue = round(ttest2$estimate, 3)) # mean
compareValues(reportedValue = 0.03, obtainedValue = se2) # SE
compareValues(reportedValue = 30, obtainedValue = ttest2$parameter) # df
```

#### Test phase
Reported: 

> Infants’ mean accuracy scores were significantly above chance, considering both initial accuracy (mean = 0.12, SE = 0.04, t(30) = 3.25, p = 0.0014; see Fig. 2, left panel) and overall accuracy (mean = 0.06, SE = 0.03, t(30) = 1.69, p = 0.050).

```{r}
# Initial accuracy, test
ttest3 <- t.test(initialAccTest$initialAccScaled, weights = initialAccTest$n_obs, alternative = "greater")
se3 <- sem(initialAccTest$initialAccScaled)

compareValues(reportedValue = 0.12, obtainedValue = round(ttest3$estimate, 2)) # mean
compareValues(reportedValue = 0.04, obtainedValue = se3) # SE
compareValues(reportedValue = 30, obtainedValue = ttest3$parameter) # df
compareValues(reportedValue = 3.25, obtainedValue = ttest3$statistic) # t
compareValues(reportedValue = 0.0014, obtainedValue = round(ttest3$p.value, 4), isP = T) # p

# Overall accuracy, test
ttest4 <- t.test(data_overall_test$overall_accuracy, weights = data_overall_test$n_obs, alternative = "greater")
se4 <- round(abs((ttest4$conf.int[1] - ttest4$estimate) / 1.96), 2)

compareValues(reportedValue = 0.06, obtainedValue = round(ttest4$estimate, 2)) # mean
compareValues(reportedValue = 0.03, obtainedValue = se4) # SE
compareValues(reportedValue = 30, obtainedValue = ttest4$parameter) # df
compareValues(reportedValue = 1.69, obtainedValue = ttest4$statistic) # t
compareValues(reportedValue = 0.050, obtainedValue = round(ttest4$p.value, 3), isP = T) # p
```

Note: The reported p-value of 0.050 was interpreted as statistically significant, but the recalculated p-value of 0.091 was not statistically significant at the 0.05 threshold. I will therefore code this discrepancy as a decision error, even though the original p value was not < 0.05.


## Step 5: Conclusion

```{r}
codReport(Report_Type = 'joint',
          Article_ID = 'UYYED', 
          Insufficient_Information_Errors = 0,
          Decision_Errors = 1, 
          Major_Numerical_Errors = 11, 
          Minor_Numerical_Errors = 3)
```

There was a minor numerical error in the descriptive statistics for left or right look during test phase (reported as 83%, found in reanalysis to be 83.5%, which I rounded to 84% for consistency). In my first analysis, I neglected to remove trials with a pronounced word (as described in the footnote on page 54), and I then arrived at 83%. One possible explanation is therefore that when the authors say "analyses" in the footnote on page 54, they intend to refer only to inferential analyses and not descriptive analyses.

There were several discrepancies in the inferential statistics, for which I have no explanation.
