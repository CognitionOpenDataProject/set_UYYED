For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> During the learning phase, infants showed at least one left or right look in 81% of the trials. Infants’ mean scores were not significantly above chance for either initial accuracy (mean = −0.02, SE = 0.03, t(30) < 1) or overall accuracy (mean = −0.002, SE = 0.03, t(30) < 1, ns). During the test phase, they showed at least one left or right look in 83% of the trials. The mean latency of the first look was 625 ms (SD: 141 ms), and its mean duration 819 ms (SD: 238 ms). Infants’ mean accuracy scores were significantly above chance, considering both initial accuracy (mean = 0.12, SE = 0.04, t(30) = 3.25, p = 0.0014; see Fig. 2, left panel) and overall accuracy (mean = 0.06, SE = 0.03, t(30) = 1.69, p = 0.050).
